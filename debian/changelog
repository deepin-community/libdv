  * Update debian/copyright as per DEP-5.
  * YUV_420_USE_YV12 option affects the wrong encoding (Closes: #466142):
    - The build configuration option --with-pal-yuv=YV12 actually affects
      encoding of "NTSC", inconsistent with decoding. This option is not
      currently used in Debian but could affect those who rebuild it.

  * configure.ac, */Makefile.am: Do not push any lib into LIBS. Define

    Closes: #167098
  * configure.ac: While libdv pulls a types from libpopt, it does not
    reference any libpopt function. Adding -lpopt to REQUIRES_NOPKGCONFIG was
    nonsense therefore--it's a purely optional feature. (The dependency on
    libpopt-dev must be retained, however, because dv_types.h includes
    popt.h.)
