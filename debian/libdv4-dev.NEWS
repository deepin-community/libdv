libdv (0.103-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Earlier versions of libdv had deprecated the use of header file dv1394.h
  provided here. Starting with version 0.103, the libdv developers have
  removed the header file entirely from their package. Compiling software
  that still includes the deprecated header shall fail now, therefore.

  Note that the dv1394.h has never been part of the libdv programming interface
  and has been provided as a (historical) courtesy only. dv1394.h defines
  solely a kernel interface. Therefore, in order to compile for a certain
  kernel version, the kernel headers, and only the kernel headers contain the
  authoritative header file. All application software should be modified
  accordingly.
